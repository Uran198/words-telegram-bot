This is a telegram bot to help learn words through spaced repetitions.

It dynamically fetches definitions from wiktionary, and uses tatoeba database
for usage examples.

Sentence data can be downloaded from tatoeba and is not included in the git
repository. It should live in data/links.csv and data/sentences.csv

It can be downloaded from here:
